        <p>in the ocean there are whales. among other marine animals and vegetation.
        there are sperm whales and blue whales and humpbacks, and belugas,
        and bowheads, and grays, and fins, and rights, and seis, and all of them live
        in different parts of the ocean on this big beautiful planet. but alas...
        the whales are under great danger due to climate change, pollution, and other
        factors.
