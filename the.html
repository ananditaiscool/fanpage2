          <p>we need whales. whales play an essential role in the food chain regulating the number of plankton in the ocean.
           their fecal matter also helps offset the carbon in the atmosphere by increasing the growth of phytoplanton that
           take carbon out of the air. other animals also in the food chain also benefit. another aspect of why whales
           are important is that they bring in money from tourism and stimulates economies.
